# Introduction #

F is a lightweight, fast, simple php MVC framework.

It may be used for develop advanced web applications.

It is light and easy to use.

It's KISS.

# Deploy new App #

It is in few simple steps.

  * Download and extract http://code.google.com/p/f-project/downloads/detail?name=f-skeleton.tar.gz
  * Rename f-skeleton directory as u wish (it's your new project)
  * make web server settings (app root is "www" subdirectory)
Apache example:

```

<VirtualHost *:80>
DocumentRoot "/webhome/myapp/www"
ServerName myapp.local
ServerAlias www.myapp.local


Unknown end tag for &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


```
  * checkout F and place it as u wish. Recently in php include path or near project directory. Directory must be named "F".
```

svn checkout http://f-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ F
```
  * make sure that application use correct F location (in myapp/www/index.php)
```

include_once "../../F/App.php";
include_once "../cfg/main.php";

F_App::instance()->run();```

  * Run F app http:://myapp.local in this case


You must see somethig like this, good luck:

<div>
<blockquote><h1>Welcome to <span>F</span> application</h1>
<br>
<br>
<hr/><br>
<br>
This is a content of main page</blockquote>

<blockquote>controller: code/Ctrl.php,indexAction<br>
template: tmpl/Ctrl/Index.html</blockquote>

<blockquote>You can create another actions and controllers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For example: <a href='example'>one</a>   <a href='some'>two</a>   <a href='some/test'>three</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>You can use <a href='?_trace=tmpl'>trace</a>.<br>
