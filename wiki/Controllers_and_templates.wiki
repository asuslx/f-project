= Introduction =

Every MVC web-application work with controllers.

In *"F"* Controllers implemented by class *F_App_Controller*.

Every request to a *"F"* web application processed by one of it's controller.

By default *main controller* located in *<project dir>/code/Ctrl.php*

= Processing requests =

Every controller must implement abstact method *{{{_initialize()}}}* and one or more *actions*. 
Action must be named strictly, depend on processing URL.

For example we create apprication what can process two URLs:

 * http://test.local/
 * http://test.local/second/

in code/Ctrl.php we shoud write:
{{{
class Ctrl extends F_App_Controller {

    protected $params = array();

    function _initialize() {
        // called before any action processed
    }

    function actionIndex($params) {
        // called when http://test.local/
    }

    function actionSecond($params) {
        // called when http://test.local/second
    }
}

}}}

= Controller templates =

Every controller *must have templates for every* it's action.

If we does not need in template we can use empty templates.

Templates for controlles locates by default in *<project dir>/tmpl/* directory.

For controller below we need to create two template files:

 *  *<project dir>/tmpl/Ctrl/Index.html* 
 *  *<project dir>/tmpl/Ctrl/Second.html*
